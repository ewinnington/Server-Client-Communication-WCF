# Server-Client-Communication-WCF
CoreWCF on DotNet 5.0 called from a WCF .net framework 4.7.2 with nettcp streaming

Testing out [CoreWCF/CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF) to see how easy it is to move .net framework WCF services that use net.tcp to .net 5.0. 

From what I see, this first release of CoreWCF gives all the basic functionality required for porting. In case you use it, security/encryption should be looked at.
